# Forsaken Powers Plus Remastered

<b>by Turbero</b>

This is a remastered version of ForsakenPowersPlus mod from <b>TastyChickenLegs</b> (his discord https://discord.gg/PQMXbUS6FH). I basically rewrote and refactored the entire mod, made it compatible with Fader power and fixed some issues around.

Idea credited back to him.

Change the forsaken powers and modify the duration and cooldown.

- Now with ServerSync - ability to turn off version check
- Complete rewrite of code
- Able to cycle through the forsaken powers to choose which one to use
- Can only use the one's you have earned
- Can change the duration and cooldown timers
- Can reset current power and start a new one - even stack powers
- Can use all powers at once with <b>Alt+F</b> (if config option is enabled)

```
To Stack Powers do the Following

In the options disable "enable reset"
Hit F and activate your power
Hit F9 to reset the power (it will remove active powers)
Hit F8 to cycle through the powers to select a new power
Hit F to start the new power. They are now stacked as in the image
```

Install the mod into your Bepinex\Plugins and start the game.
Config file will be generated in the Bepinex\Config folder.
